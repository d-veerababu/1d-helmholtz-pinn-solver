# Solving 1D Helmholtz equation using PINNs
This repository provides an efficient, customizable approach to solve the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation, which is a frequency domain representation of the sound wave equation in the MATLAB environment using L-BFGS optimizer. The theory associated with the code is available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2024.118476. The article consists the formulation for the sound propagation in the uniformd duct, gradually varying cross-sectional duct, and narrow duct. 

In this repository, the code associated with the Uniform Duct, which is ideal for researchers, students, and practitioners in acoustics, computational physics and scientific machine learning, is provided.

Comments are available at the respective sections inside the code and are self-explanatory.

## How to run the code
1) Open the folder 'Uniform_duct'
2) Open the file 'main.m' in the MATLAB editor and run

Make sure that all the supporting files and 'main.m' file contained in the same folder. 

## Prerequisites
The following tools boxes are required to run the code in MATLAB environment
1) Optimization Toolbox
2) Deep Learning Toolbox
3) Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
